## Glide Application Documentation

Glide is an open source slideshow application for comics.
For now the application is entirely in development mode. That means the following:
- **0 user support**
    - You can ask questions or something. I might read them. Maybe.
- **No ETAs on anything**
- **Minimal execution capabilities**
    - If you want to run the code you'll need to download and compile it yourself.
- **Not versioned or packaged**
    - This repo is not set up with versioning or releases yet and there will be no indication of current feature support
    - This repo is not set up to be easily distributed or installed.
- **Master will be rebased occasionally**
